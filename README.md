# Layla's Game

## Description

Layla's game is a math game for kids (elementary school aged) where players start the game by hitting the start game button which generates a random number which is the goal value. Players then must select cards (1-10) that their sum is equal to the goal value. If players match the goal value they win, if they go over they lose.
