# Layla's Game

## Description

Layla's game is a math game for kids (elementary school aged) where players start the game by hitting the start game button which generates a random number which is the goal value. Players then must select cards (1-10) that their sum is equal to the goal value. If players match the goal value they win, if they go over they lose.

## How to use my code

To install the code for this app on your local computer complete the following steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run npm install both on the root folder as well as the client folder.
3. run npm start

### Note on installing code

If you plan to run the app locally, you do not need to have the backend (server file). You can skip the npm install on the root folder and just work in the client folder and run npm start from there, after running npm install, and the app should work locally.
